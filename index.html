The structure includes a top navigation bar for quick access to key sections: Overview, Competitor Analysis, Content Calendar, and Strategy. This thematic organization allows users to easily consume high-level insights first (dashboard charts), dive into competitive context, explore the detailed, filterable calendar, and finally review strategic guidelines. This flow is more intuitive than a linear report, promoting exploration and quick access to relevant information. Key interactions include dropdown filters for the calendar (by week, topic, objective) and clickable post cards that reveal full content in a modal, keeping the main interface clean and focused. -->    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:         - Report Info: Content mix across 8 weeks. Goal: Inform on strategic balance. Viz/Method: Doughnut Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Hover for tooltips showing percentages. Justification: Instantly communicates the proportional focus on different content pillars.        - Report Info: Posts per strategic objective. Goal: Compare effort vs. goals. Viz/Method: Bar Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Hover for tooltips showing post counts. Justification: Clearly visualizes the volume of content dedicated to each marketing funnel stage.        - Report Info: 32 individual posts. Goal: Organize and detail the schedule. Viz/Method: Interactive Grid of Cards (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: Filtering by week/topic/objective and clicking a card to open a modal with full post details. Justification: Provides a high-level overview while allowing deep dives without cluttering the UI. This is superior to a static list for exploring a multi-week strategy.        - Report Info: Competitor analysis findings. Goal: Inform on market context. Viz/Method: Accordion/Tabbed section (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: Click to expand details for each competitor. Justification: Organizes detailed text-based analysis compactly.    -->    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used.
